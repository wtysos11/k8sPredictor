# k8sPredictor
Plan to make a k8s predictor based on the paper Clustering to Forecast Sparse Time-Series Data. Try to use cluster to make predictor work in a more effcient way.

The data I will use comes from [wikipedia's pageview](https://dumps.wikimedia.org/other/pageviews/). First I need to download all the data as wiki's API doesn't provide interval of hour, which I really need hourly data.
